**Date:** 2021-02-05 13:00  
**Participants:** Oliver, Axel, Emma, Magnus, Jan  
**Responsible for the meeting:** Axel, Emma

## Done since last meeting: 
Finished class diagram.  
Started creating a plan for parsing.  
Researched parsing options and generators.  
Wrote down explanations for the class diagram and pros and cons of different approaches to parsing in planning notes.  

## Discussion during the meeting:
We tell Jan that we are done with the class diagram for the SysML v2 definitions.  
We explain to Jan that we have started to setup a plan for the parsing.  
We explain our thoughts around the parser choice we have discussed during the week.  
We show our pro and con list for the different parser options.The choices are a new parser generator or the old one that was used.  
Jan explains that we are the ones who have the final decision but that he leans more towards using a parser generator since this is 
a new thing that has not been tested before in the project. That is the choice we were leaning towards so we will probably choose that one.  
We show the generator on the web that we have started working on. Jan thinks itâ€™s cool.

## For the next meeting:
More planning of the parser and working on parsing.  
Prepare for the seminar.

**Date for next meeting:** 2021-02-15 13:00
