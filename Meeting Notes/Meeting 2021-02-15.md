**Responsible for the meeting:**Oliver, Magnus

## Done since last meeting: 
Chosen the library for graphical representation.
Presented our project for the class.  

## Questions for Jan and things to bring up:
Is the amount of planning adequate? Do you want more detailed planning?

## Discussion during the meeting:
We show Jan the demo for parsing made in the PEG.js parser generator.
We explain the path that we are gonna take by creating essentially a demo with the most basic parts.
We show the library we chose for the graphical representation and explains that it should work for SysML since it works in draw.io
Discussing how when we start coding we can probably work more flexibly as we can split up and be more efficient. 
Oliver brings up the idea to start a github page from the project repository with a “webpage” branch


## For the next meeting:
Make a sprint 2 plan.
Start writing object definitions
Start implementing graphical library
