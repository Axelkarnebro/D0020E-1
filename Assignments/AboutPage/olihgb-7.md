# About Me page of Oliver Högberg

My name is Oliver Högberg and I am one of four collaborators on this project about rendering SysML 2.0 in a web browser for the course D0020E (Project in Computer Sciendce) at LTU.
I am currently studying my last year at LTU (Luleå University of Technology) towards a Degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering with regards to Computer Science (swe: Högskoleingenjör i Datateknik).

Other than studying at LTU some of my interests include: 
* Music in general, but specifically going to concerts and festivals
* Ocationall gaming; mostly exploring new, creative indie developer games
* Coding/Programming
* Learning about subjects of Computer Science (thus the reason I study what I study)
