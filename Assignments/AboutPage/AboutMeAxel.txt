My name is Axel Kärnebro. I’m 22 years old and I study computer science at the civil engineering program at LTU. 
I like to spend way too much of my free time playing a 19 year old video game trying to become one of the best players in Sweden. 
I moved to Luleå from Umeå where my family lives and where I grew up (mostly). 
I would describe myself as funny and smart but my crippling self-confidence issues don’t allow me to. 
I’ve always been interested in computers and computer science and I’ve enjoyed math so to me working in this field was the obvious choice.
