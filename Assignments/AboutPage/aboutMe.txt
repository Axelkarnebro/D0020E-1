My name is Magnus Stenfelt i am 21 years old and i live in luleå.
I am 183cm tall and i weigh around 84kg. I was born and raised in
a village called Hedesunda 40km from Gävle. I lived there until i
was 16 after which we moved into Gävle. That is where i went to
upper secondary school and finished a technical education. With
that education i was able to get into LTU. I moved to Luleå and
started attending LTU when i was 19 years old. I am a happy, 
driven, dorky and fun person if i do say so myself. 

My time is divided inbetween studying, working at stuk, LARV, 
the union council where i represent Datasektionen and its members.
I also aim to work out at the gym 5-7 times a week. I love series,
movies and gaming while not doing these things.
