About me, Emma Carlsson
My name is Emma Carlsson and I’m on my third year of Civilingenjör Datateknik at LTU. I was born and raised in Algutsrum, 
a village on Öland in south-east Sweden. In gymnasiet I went to a technical program and got to try programming for the first 
time, which I enjoyed and so decided on my current education. I chose LTU because i wanted to try something new and because 
I like winter and skiing. My other interests include playing video games, reading books and crochet.
